# UTSA_10_sqlalchemy_challenge

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

# Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

In this section, I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. Specifically, I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib to perform a precipitation analysis on the last 12 months of precipitation data, as well as a station analysis to determine the most active reporting station and the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures reported at that station over the same 12 month period.

# Part 2: Design a Climate App

When running the climate app, the index page shows the available routes within the app.  To use these routes, simply copy the line beneath the description and paste it on the end of the URL.

The final two routes require an additional step.  For the 4th route, replace the "yyyy-mm-dd" with the date being investigated in the year-month-day format.  For the 5th route, replace "start:yyyy-mm-dd" and "end:yyyy-mm-dd" with the appropriate dates in the year-month-day format.
